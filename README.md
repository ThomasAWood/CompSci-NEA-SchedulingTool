# Music Lesson Scheduling Project

A full stack web development project I did to learn the basics of full stack web dev. The site allows students and teachers to create accounts, teachers can create bookable lesson slots that are one off or repeat every week or two weeks etc. Students can create accounts and then book lesson slots created by their teachers.
